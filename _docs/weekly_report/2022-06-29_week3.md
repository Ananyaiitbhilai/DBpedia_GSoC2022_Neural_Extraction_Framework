This week, I didn’t work much but performed the following tasks and observed the following things :  

### Entity mapping

Mapped URIs/URLs of articles to their labels(which are similar to the the article’s title)
There are 2 such properties *dbp:name* and *rdf:labels*. Since I wasn’t able to see the property *dbp:name* on every article’s page in the dbpedia database, so went with *rdf:labels* instead. 
```
PREFIX  rdfs:  <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
 SELECT ?title
 WHERE { <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Berlin_Wall>
        rdfs:label ?title .
FILTER (lang(?title) = 'en')
```

But there were some articles which had very few or no properties.

### Entity recognition and extraction 

In our case, hyperlinks act as entities only, as stated in the goal of the problem statement: ***predicate resolution of wiki links among entities.***

However, after scraping all the text of the article Berlin Wall, I used *spaCy library* to find the entities. I used to believe that in most cases named entity will be a hyperlink in the article but it was not fully true. It was found that many entities that were recognised by *spaCy* lib were also the hyperlinks, which we found by running the SPARQL query using *dbo:wikiPageWikiLink*, in the scraped text. 

I extracted entities by 2 methods: 
- by running sparql query -> returns hyperlinks present in an article ->  which act as entities in our case. 
- And by using spacy library.
e.g. 
> <span style="color:red">Iron curtain</span> was recognised as an entity when we ran the SPARQL query but was not recognised as an entity by *spaCy* lib.
> <span style="color:red">August</span> didn't come when we ran the SPARQL query but *spaCy* lib recogonised it as an entity. 

![SPARQL Query dbo:wikiPageWikiLink hyperlinks present in wikipedia article](https://ananyaiitbhilai.github.io/DBpedia_GSoC2022_Neural_Extraction_Framework/images/wikipidea_hyperlink-ner.png)

*Fig8*

I think that the entities which are not returned by the SPARQL query hold relatively less significance since we have to identify the relation between the articles(which are entities in our case)

Today I am looking into coreference resolution.
