## Community Bonding Period (May 20 - June 12)

The GSoC'22 community bonding phase has come to a conclusion. On the night of May 20th, I was a little agitated because I was excitedly awaiting the GSoC mail and was constantly refreshing my email every second.  Around 30-40 minutes were passed since the results were expected to be announced, but there was no evidence of any email in my inbox till then. I was going through my phone, flipping between applications, when I noticed a message from one of the GSOC mentors, who is also my college alumnus. I was elated to hear this news. It is a significant turning point in my college career and a wonderful accomplishment.

### GSoC virtual gathering
I met some other GSoCers during the community bonding phase and learned about their projects. Listening to various projects was a lot of fun for me. My batchmates were also selected for GSoC, thus an internal group was formed to keep each other informed about deadlines and other matters. On June 3rd, the Google Summer of Code programme management sent out an invitation to all GSoC'22 contributors for a virtual gathering. It began at 8:30 p.m. IST and ended at 12:30 a.m. IST. 
In that meet, I came to know about the following things:
- Software licencing 
- How to start your GSoC project 
- Staying in touch with mentors and updating them on a regular basis 
- A flexible deadline dependent on the project size you choose 
- Advice from ex-GSocers and many more.

### First meet with my mentors
My weekly calls with my mentors, Tomasso, Dieago, and Ziewi, take place every Wednesday at 4:30 p.m. IST. On the 8th of June, I had my first weekly call with them. It began with all of the mentors introducing themselves, followed by my introduction. In the year 2021, Ziewi was the GSoC contributor for this project. 
I was added to the ***DBpedia organisation*** and added as a collaborator in the ***DBpedia/neural-extraction-framework*** GitHub repo. In the above repo, I've created a branch called ***gsoc22-ananya*** for myself. To get my work merged with the main branch of the repo, I need to update all of my work in this branch and create a PR during mid-evals and final evals.
During the call, I was also given the following general instructions: 
- Use Slack to communicate
- Update my mentors on a daily basis with a one-line synopsis
- Have to blog weekly in an elaborated way about my progress/work

### DBpedia's GSoC mentor/contributor meet-up
Our organisation, DBpedia, hosted a meeting for all mentors and contributors on June 10th from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. IST. I learned about the project ideas of other contributors and received some general instructions from the mentors for GSoC'22.

I am very excited to start my GSoC contribution journey.
